# Caching (Python)

This project explores the construction and use of caching systems, using Python. This will also include an exploration of:
  - FIFO (first in, first out)
  - LIFO (last in, first out)
  - LRU (least recently used)
  - MRU (most recently used)
  - LFU (least frequently used)
  - Limits within caching systems
